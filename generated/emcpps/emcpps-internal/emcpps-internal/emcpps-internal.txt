                                   John Lakos, author of Large-Scale C++ Software Design
                                   (Addison-Wesley, 1996) and Large-Scale C++ Volume I: Process
                                   and Architecture (Addison-Wesley, 2019), serves at Bloomberg
                                   in New York City as a senior architect and mentor for C++
                                   software development worldwide. He is also an active voting
                                   member of the C++ Standards Committee’s Evolution Working
                                   Group. From 1997 to 2001, Dr. Lakos directed the design and
                                   development of infrastructure libraries for proprietary analytic
                                   financial applications at Bear Stearns. From 1983 to 1997, Dr.
                                   Lakos was employed at Mentor Graphics, where he developed
                                   large frameworks and advanced ICCAD applications for which
        he holds multiple software patents. His academic credentials include a Ph.D. in Computer
        Science (1997) and an Sc.D. in Electrical Engineering (1989) from Columbia University. Dr.
        Lakos received his undergraduate degrees from MIT in Mathematics (1982) and Computer
        Science (1981).


          Vittorio Romeo (B.Sc., Computer Science, 2016) is a senior software engineer at
          Bloomberg in London, working on mission-critical C++ middleware and delivering mod-
          ern C++ training to hundreds of fellow employees. He began programming at the age
          of 8 and quickly fell in love with C++. Vittorio has created several open-source C++
          libraries and games, has published many video courses and tutorials, and actively par-
          ticipates in the ISO C++ standardization process. He is an active member of the C++
          community with an ardent desire to share his knowledge and learn from others: He
          presented more than 20 times at international C++ conferences (including CppCon,
          C++Now, ++it, ACCU, C++ On Sea, C++ Russia, and Meeting C++), covering top-
          ics from game development to template metaprogramming. Vittorio maintains a web-
          site (https://vittorioromeo.info/) with advanced C++ articles and a YouTube channel
        (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XihgHdkNOQd5IBHnIZWbA) featuring well re-
        ceived modern C++11/14 tutorials. He is active on StackOverflow, taking great care in
        answering interesting C++ questions (75k+ reputation). When he is not writing code, Vit-
        torio enjoys weightlifting and fitness-related activities as well as computer gaming and sci-fi
        movies.

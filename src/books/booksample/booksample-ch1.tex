\chapter{Chapter Number One}

This will be chapter one.

This is some code that is typeset inline \cppcode{void foo() \{return;\}}

The header would contain
\begin{cppcodeblock}{bsmch1_sample1_h}
  void foo(); // this is a comment

  /*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  */
\end{cppcodeblock}

The implementation file would contain
\begin{cppcodeblock}{bsmch1_sample1_cpp}
void foo() {
  return;                                                             // RETURN
}
\end{cppcodeblock}

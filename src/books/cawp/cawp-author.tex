From 1983 to 1997, Dr. Lakos was employed at Mentor Graphics, where he developed large frameworks and advanced ICCAD applications for which he holds multiple software patents. His academic credentials include a Ph.D. in Computer Science (1997) and an Sc.D. in Electrical Engineering (1989) from Columbia University. Dr. Lakos received his undergraduate degrees from MIT in Mathematics (1982) and Computer Science (1981).

\begin{wrapfigure}[12]{L}[0pt]{0pt}\includegraphics{cawp-authorphoto-JMB}\end{wrapfigure} \noindent Joshua Berne serves at Bloomberg LP as a senior software engineer on Bloomberg’s core library team. After the difficult choice to pursue a career in software engineering over research mathematics, he has been an active programmer in the financial industry, writing day trading applications in C++ for E*TRADE Capital Markets and, after that, architecting large distributed trading systems in Java for Instinet and IDC. Since joining Bloomberg in 2017, he has been an active participant in the C++ Standards Committee, seeking to bring the advancements made within Bloomberg to the C++ Standard and thus to the rest of the world.

After the difficult choice to pursue a career in software engineering over research mathematics, he has been an active programmer in the financial industry, writing day trading applications in C++ for E*TRADE Capital Markets and, after that, architecting large distributed trading systems in Java for Instinet and IDC. Since joining Bloomberg in 2017, he has been an active participant in the C++ Standards Committee, seeking to bring the advancements made within Bloomberg to the C++ Standard and thus to the rest of the world.

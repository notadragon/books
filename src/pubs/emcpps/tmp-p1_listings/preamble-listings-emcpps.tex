% A batch id for code snippets that should be concatenated together to compile.
\lst@Key{emcppsbatch}{}{\def\emcppsBatch{#1}}

% A reason why this code snippet should not be compiled, such as code that is
% explained outside of the example as an error, or code that is more
% descriptive than actually valid code.  Useless and irrelevant on
% emcppshiddenslistings.

% Which standards the code example should be compiled for, which will be passed
% to the -std= argument of gcc or clang  This must be on the first snippet in a
% batch, otherwise a default oc "c++11,c++14" will be used.
% Example value [emcppsstandards={c++11,c++17}]

% Provides an alternate output file name for this snippet.  Multiple snippets
% in the same batch with the same output file name will be concatenated.

The\lstinline![[carries_dependency]]! attribute provides a means to
manually identify function parameters and \lstinline!return! values as
components of \emcppsgloss[data dependency chain]{data dependency chains} to enable (primarily
across translation units) use of the lighter-weight
\emcppsgloss[release consume]{release-consume} \emcppsgloss{synchronization paradigm} as an
optimization over the more conservative \emcppsgloss[release acquire]{release-acquire}
paradigm.{\cprotect\footnote{The authors would like to thank Michael
Wong, Paul McKenney, and Maged Michael for reviewing and contributing to this feature section.}}

\subsection[Description]{Description}\label{description}

C++11 ushered in support for multithreading by introducing a rigorously
specified memory model. The Standard Library provides support for
managing threads, including their execution, synchronization, and
intercommunication. As a part of the new memory model, the Standard
defines various \emcppsgloss[synchronization operation]{synchronization operations} that are classified as either \emph{sequentially
consistent}, \emph{release}, \emph{acquire},
\emph{release-and-acquire}, or \emph{consume} operations. These
operations play a key role in making changes in data in one thread
visible in another.

The modern C++ memory model describes two \emcppsgloss[synchronization
paradigm]{synchronization paradigms} that are used
to coordinate data flow among concurrent threads of execution. The current suite of supported
\emcppsgloss[synchronization paradigm]{synchronization paradigms} comprises \emcppsgloss[release acquire]{release-acquire} and \emcppsgloss[release consume]{release-consume}, although in practice
\emcppsgloss[release consume]{release-consume} is implemented in terms of \emcppsgloss[release acquire]{release-acquire} in all known implementations. In
particular, the \emcppsgloss[release consume]{release-consume} paradigm requires that the
compiler be given fine-grained understanding of the \emcppsgloss[intra thread dependency]{intra-thread dependencies} among the reads and writes within a program
and relates those to atomic \emph{release stores} and \emph{consume
loads} that happen concurrently across multiple threads of execution.
Dependency chains in the \emcppsgloss[release consume]{release-consume} synchronization
paradigm specify which evaluations following the \emph{consume load} are
\emcppsgloss{ordered after} a corresponding \emph{release store}.

\subsubsection[The release-acquire paradigm]{The release-acquire paradigm}\label{the-release-acquire-paradigm}

A \emph{release} operation writes a value to a memory location, and an
\emph{acquire} operation reads a value from a memory location. Although many have
referred to the release-acquire paradigm as \emph{acquire-release}, the proper, standard,
  time-ordered nomenclature is \emph{release-acquire}. In a \emcppsgloss[release acquire]{release-acquire} pair, the acquire operation reads the value written by
the release operation, which means that all of the reads and writes to
\emph{any} memory location \emph{before the release operation} happen
before \emph{all} of the reads and writes \emph{after the acquire operation}. Note that this paradigm does \emph{not} use
dependency chains or the \lstinline![[carries_dependency]]! attribute. See \intraref{use-cases-carriesdependency}{producer-consumer-programming-pattern}
%{\intraref{{Use Cases: A producer-consumer implementation}}} below
for a
complete example that implements this paradigm.

\subsubsection[Data dependency]{Data dependency}\label{data-dependency}

In the current revisions of C++, \emcppsgloss{data dependency} is defined as
existing whenever the output of one evaluation is used as the input of
another.
 When one evaluation has a data dependency on another
evaluation, the second evaluation is said to \emcppsgloss{carry dependency}
to the other. The Standard Library function
\lstinline!std::kill_dependency! is also related and can be used to
  \emph{break} a data dependency chain. Naturally the compiler must
ensure that any evaluation that depends on another must not be started
until the first evaluation is complete. A \emcppsgloss{data dependency chain}
is formed when multiple evaluations carry dependency transitively; the
output of one evaluation is used as the input of the next evaluation in
the chain.

\subsubsection[The release-consume paradigm]{The release-consume paradigm}\label{the-release-consume-paradigm}

Some systems use the read-copy-update (RCU) synchronization mechanism.
This approach preserves the order of \emph{loads} and \emph{stores} that
form in a \emcppsgloss{data dependency chain}, which is a sequence of
\emph{loads} and \emph{stores} in which the input to one operation is an
output of another. A compiler can use guaranteed order of loads
and stores provided by the RCU synchronization mechanism for performance purposes by omitting certain
\emcppsgloss[memory fence instruction]{memory-fence instructions} that would otherwise be required to
enforce the correct ordering. In such cases, however, ordering is
guaranteed only between those operations making up the relevant
\emcppsgloss{data dependency chain}. The C++ definition
of data dependency is intended to mimic the data dependency on RCU
systems. Note, however, that C++ currently defines data dependency in
terms of evaluations, while RCU data dependency is defined in terms of
  loads and stores.

This optimization was intended to be available in C++ through use of a
\emph{release-consume} pair, which, as its name
suggests, consists of a \emph{release-store} operation and a
\emph{consume-load} operation. A \emph{consume} operation is much like
an \emph{acquire} operation, except that it guarantees only the ordering
of those evaluations in a \emcppsgloss{data dependency chain}, starting with
the consume-load operation.

Note, however, that currently no known implementation is able to take
advantage of the current C++ \emph{consume} semantics; hence, all
current compilers promote \emph{consume} loads to \emph{acquire} loads,
effectively making the \lstinline![[carries_dependency]]! attribute
redundant. Revisions to render this feature implementable and therefore
usable are currently under consideration by the C++ Standards Committee.
Prototypes for various approaches have been produced. When a usable
feature with real implementations is delivered, it quite possibly will
not work exactly as described in the examples here; see \intrarefsimple{use-cases-carriesdependency}.
% {\intraref{{Use Cases}}}, below.

\subsubsection[Using the {\protect\lstinline![[carries_dependency]]!} attribute]{Using the {\SubsubsecCode [[carries\_dependency]]} attribute}\label{using-the-[[carries_dependency]]-attribute}

\emcppsgloss[data dependency chain]{Data dependency chains} can and do propagate into and out of
called functions. If one of these interoperating functions is in a
separate translation unit, the compiler will have no way of seeing the
dependency chain. In such cases, the user can apply the
\lstinline![[carries_dependency]]! attribute to imbue the necessary
information for the compiler to track the propagation of dependency
chains into and out of functions across translation units, thus possibly
avoiding unnecessary memory-fence instructions; see \intrarefsimple{use-cases-carriesdependency}. Note that the Standard Library function
\lstinline!std::kill_dependency! is also related and can be used to
  \emph{break} a data dependency chain.
% {\intrarefsub{{Using the \lstinline![[carries_dependency]]! attribute}}}, below.

The \lstinline![[carries_dependency]]! attribute can be applied to a
function declaration as a whole by placing it in front of the function declaration,
in which case the attribute applies to the \lstinline!return! value:

\begin{emcppslisting}
[[carries_dependency]] int* f();  // attribute applied to entire function (첫{\codeincomments{f}}첫)
\end{emcppslisting}

\noindent In the example above, the \lstinline![[carries_dependency]]! attribute was
applied to the declaration of function \lstinline!f! to indicate that the
\lstinline!return! value carries a dependency out of the function. The
compiler may now be able to avoid emitting a memory-fence instruction
for the return value of \lstinline!f!.

The \lstinline![[carries_dependency]]! attribute can also be applied
to one or more of the function's parameter declarations by placing it
immediately after the parameter name:

\begin{emcppslisting}
void g(int* input [[carries_dependency]]); // attribute applied to (첫{\codeincomments{input}}첫)
\end{emcppslisting}

\noindent In the declaration of function \lstinline!g! in the example above, the
\lstinline![[carries_dependency]]! attribute is applied to the
\lstinline!input! parameter to indicate that a dependency is carried
through that parameter into the function, which may obviate the
compiler's having to emit an unnecessary memory-fence instruction for
the \lstinline!input! parameter; see \featureref{\locationa}{attributes}.
%{\intraref{{Attribute Syntax}}}.

In both cases, if a function or a parameter declaration specifies the
\lstinline![[carries_dependency]]! attribute, the first declaration of
that function shall specify that \lstinline![[carries_dependency]]!
attribute. Similarly, if the first declaration of a function or one of
its parameters specifies the \lstinline![[carries_dependency]]! attribute
in one translation unit and the first declaration of the same function
in another translation unit doesn't, the program is \emcppsgloss{ill formed, no diagnostic required (IFNDR)}.

%The user is responsible for ensuring that an existing dependency chain
%is available if needed for synchronization purposes. The
%\lstinline![[carries_dependency]]! attribute will not create a \mbox{dependency}.

It is important to note that while the \lstinline![[carries_dependency]]! attribute informs the compiler about the presence of a dependency chain, it does not itself create one.  The dependency chain must be present in the implementation to have any effect on synchronization.

\subsubsection[Producer-consumer programming pattern]{Producer-consumer programming pattern}\label{producer-consumer-programming-pattern}

The popular producer-consumer programming pattern uses
\emph{release-acquire} pairs to synchronize between threads:

\end{emcppslisting}

\noindent When this \emph{release-acquire} \emph{synchronization paradigm} is
used, the compiler must maintain the ordering of the statements to avoid
breaking the \emph{release-acquire} guarantee; the compiler will also
need to insert memory-fence instructions to prevent the hardware from
breaking this guarantee.

If we wanted to modify the example above to use \emph{release-consume}
semantics, we would somehow need to make the \lstinline!assert! statements
a part of the dependency chain on the \lstinline!load! from the
\lstinline!guard! object. We can accomplish this because reading data
through a pointer establishes a dependency chain between the reading of
that pointer value and the reading of the referenced data.  Since \emph{release-consume} allows the developer to specify that data of concern, using that policy instead of \emph{release-acquire} policy (in the code example above) allows the compiler to be more selective in its use of memory fences::

\noindent Finally, if we want to start to refactor the work of
the \lstinline!my_sharedata! component into multiple
 functions across different
translation units, we would want to carefully apply the
\lstinline![[carries_dependency]]! attribute to the newly refactored
functions, so calling into these functions might conceivably be better
optimized:

\subsection[Potential Pitfalls]{Potential Pitfalls}\label{potential-pitfalls}

\subsubsection[No practical use on current platforms]{No practical use on current platforms}\label{no-practical-use-on-current-platforms}

All known compilers promote \emph{consume} loads to \emph{acquire}
loads, thus failing to omit superfluous memory-fence instructions.
Developers writing code with the expectation that it will be run under
the more efficient \emcppsgloss[release consume]{release-consume} \emcppsgloss{synchronization paradigm} will find that their code will continue to work --- as
expected --- under the more conservative \emcppsgloss[release acquire]{release-acquire}
guarantees until such time as a theoretical, not-yet-existent compiler
that properly supports the \emcppsgloss[release consume]{release-consume}
\emcppsgloss{synchronization paradigm} becomes widely available. In the
meantime, applications that require the potential performance benefits
of \emph{consume} semantics typically make careful use of platform-specific functionality instead.{\cprotect\footnote{Since C++17, the
use of \lstinline!memory_order_consume! has been explicitly
  discouraged after the acceptance of \cite{boehm16}. The specific
  note in the standard now says, ``Prefer
  \lstinline!memory_order_acquire!, which provides stronger guarantees
  than \lstinline!memory_order_consume!. Implementations have found it infeasible to provide performance better
  than that of \lstinline!memory_order_acquire!. Specification revisions
  are under consideration'' (\cite{iso17}, section~32.4 ``Order and Consistency," paragraph~1.3, Note~1, p.~1346). }}

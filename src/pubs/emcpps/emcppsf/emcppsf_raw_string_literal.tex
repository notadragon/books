Raw string literals obviate the need to escape each contained special
character individually.

\subsection[Description]{Description}\label{description}

A \emph{raw} string literal is a new form of syntax for string literals
that allows developers to embed arbitrary character sequences in a
program's source code, without having to modify them by escaping
individual special characters. As an introductory example, suppose that
we want to write a small program to print out a line of code:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
printf("Hello, %s%c\n", "World", '!');
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent In C++03, capturing the C statement above in a string literal would
require five escape (\texttt{$\backslash$}) characters distributed
throughout the string:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
#include <iostream>  // (ù{\codeincomments{std::cout}}ù), (ù{\codeincomments{std::endl}}ù)

int main()
{
    std::cout << "printf(\"Hello, %s%c\\n\", \"World\", '!');" << std::endl;
    return 0;  //        ^            ^  ^   ^      ^
               //             escaped characters
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent If we use C++11's \emph{raw} string-literal syntax, no escaping is
required:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
#include <iostream>  // (ù{\codeincomments{std::cout}}ù), (ù{\codeincomments{std::endl}}ù)

int main()
{
    std::cout << R"(printf("Hello, %s%c\n", "World", '!');)" << std::endl;
    return 0;  //^ ^                                      ^
               //   additional raw string-literal syntax (C++11)
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent To represent the original character
data as a raw string literal, we typically need only to add a capital \texttt{R} immediately
(adjacently) before the starting quote (\texttt{"}) and nest the
character data within parentheses, \texttt{(}~\texttt{)} (with some exceptions; see \textit{\titleref{collisions}} on page~\pageref{collisions}). Sequences of
characters that would be escaped in a regular string literal are instead
interpreted verbatim:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
const char s0[] = R"({ "key": "value" })";
    // OK, equivalent to (ù{\codeincomments{"\{ $\backslash$"key$\backslash$": $\backslash$"value$\backslash$" \}"}}ù)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent In contrast to conventional string literals, \emph{raw} string literals
(1) treat unescaped embedded double quotes (\texttt{"}) as literal data,
(2) do not interpret special-character escape sequences (e.g.,
\texttt{$\backslash$n}, \texttt{$\backslash$t}), and (3) interpret all
whitespace characters (i.e., vertical\footnote{In conventional string literals, a
new line in the source before the end of a string is considered an error.
If new lines are desired, they must be represented with an escape
sequence as \texttt{$\backslash$n}.} as well as horizontal) present in
the source file as part of the string contents{\cprotect\footnote{In
this example, we assume that all trailing whitespace has been stripped
since even trailing whitespace in a raw literal would be captured.}}:


\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
const char s1[] = R"(line one
line two
    line three)";
    // OK
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Note that any literal tab characters are treated the same as a
\texttt{$\backslash$t} and hence can be problematic, especially when
developers have inconsistent tab settings; see \textit{\titleref{potential-pitfalls-rawstringliteral}: \titleref{unexpected-indentation}} on page~\pageref{unexpected-indentation}. Finally, all string literals are concatenated with
adjacent ones in the same way the conventional ones are in C++03:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
const char s2[] = R"(line one)"         "\n"
                    "line two"          "\n"
                  R"(    line three)";
    // OK, equivalent to (ù{\codeincomments{"line one$\backslash$nlinetwo$\backslash$n~~~~line three"}}ù)
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection[Collisions]{Collisions}\label{collisions}

Although unlikely, the data to be expressed within a
string literal might itself have the character sequence \texttt{)"}
embedded within it:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
printf("printf(\"Hello, World!\")")
//                             ^^
// The (ù{\codeincomments{)"}}ù) character sequence terminates a typical raw string literal.
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent If we use the basic syntax for a \emph{raw} string literal we will get a
syntax error:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++,]
const char s3[] = R"(printf("printf(\"Hello, World!\")"))";  (ù{\codeincomments{\color{skyblue}\ttfamily\itshape // collision}}ù)
(ù{\codeincomments{\color{skyblue}\ttfamily\itshape //}}ù)                                                    (ù{\codeincomments{\color{skyblue}\ttfamily\itshape\textasciicircum\textasciicircum}}ù)
(ù{\codeincomments{\color{skyblue}\ttfamily\itshape //}}ù)                       (ù{\codeincomments{\color{skyblue}\ttfamily\itshape Syntax error after literal ends}}ù)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent To circumvent this problem, we could escape every special character in
the string separately, as in C++03, but the result is difficult to read
and error prone:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
const char s4[] = "printf(\"printf(\\\"Hello, World!\\\")\")";  // error prone
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Instead, we can use the (extended) disambiguation syntax of \emph{raw}
string literals to resolve the issue:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
const char s5[] = R"###(printf("printf(\"Hello, World!\")"))###";  (ù{\codeincomments{\color{skyblue}\ttfamily\itshape // cleaner}}ù)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent This disambiguation syntax allows us to insert an essentially
arbitrary{\cprotect\footnote{The delimiter of a raw string literal can
comprise any member of the \textbf{basic source character set} except
space, backslash, parentheses, and the control characters representing
  horizontal tab, vertical tab, form feed, and new line.}} sequence of
characters between the outermost quote/parentheses pairs that avoids the
collision with the literal data when taken as a combined sequence (e.g.,
\texttt{)\#\#\#"}):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
//                       delimiter and parenthesis
//                  v~~~                           ~~~v
const char s6[] = R"xyz(<-- Literal String Data -->)xyz";
//                ^     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^
//                |          string contents
//                |
//                | uppercase (ù{\codeincomments{R}}ù)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent The value of \texttt{s6} above is equivalent to
\texttt{"<--}~\texttt{Literal}~\texttt{String}~\texttt{Data}~\texttt{-->"}.
Every raw string literal comprises these syntactical elements, in order:
\begin{itemize}
\item{an uppercase \texttt{R}}
\item{the opening double quotes, \texttt{"}}
\item{an optional arbitrary sequence of characters called the \emph{delimiter} (e.g., \texttt{xyz})}
\item{the opening parenthesis, \texttt{(}}
\item{the contents of the string}
\item{the closing parenthesis, \texttt{)}}
\item{the same delimiter (if any) specified previously (i.e., \texttt{xyz}, not reversed)}
\item{the closing double quotes, \texttt{"}}
\end{itemize}

The delimiter can be (and, in practice, very often is) an empty character
sequence:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
const char s7[] = R"("Hello, World!")";
    // OK, equivalent to (ù{\codeincomments{$\backslash$"Hello, World!$\backslash$"}}ù)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent A nonempty delimiter (e.g.,~\texttt{!}) can be used to disambiguate any
appearance of the \texttt{)"} character sequence within the literal data

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
const char s8[] = R"!("--- R"(Raw literals are not recursive!)" ---")!";
    // OK, equivalent to (ù{\codeincomments{$\backslash$"--- R$\backslash$"(Raw literals are not recursive!)$\backslash$" ---$\backslash$"}}ù)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Had an empty delimiter been used to initialize \texttt{s8} (above), the
compiler would have produced a (perhaps obscure) compile-time error:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
 // error: decrement of read-only location

 const char s8[] = R"("--- R"(Raw literals are not recursive!)" ---")";
 //                                                              ^~
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent In fact, it could turn out that a program with an unexpectedly
terminated \emph{raw} string literal could still be valid and compile
quietly:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
printf(R"("Live-Free, don't (ever)","Die!");
    (ù{\codeincomments{// Prints: "Live-Free, don't (ever}}ù)

printf((R"("Live-Free, don't (ever)","Die!"));
    (ù{\codeincomments{// Prints: Die!}}ù)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Fortunately, examples like the one above are invariably contrived, not
accidental.

\subsection[Use Cases]{Use Cases}\label{use-cases}

\subsubsection[Embedding code in a C++ program]{Embedding code in a C++ program}\label{embedding-code-in-a-c++-program}

When a source code snippet needs to be embedded as part of the source
code of a C++ program, use of a \emph{raw} string literal can
significantly reduce the syntactic noise that would otherwise be caused
by repeated escape sequences. As an example, consider a regular
expression (for an online shopping product ID) represented as a
conventional string literal:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
const char* productIdRegex = "[0-9]{5}\\(\".*\"\\)";
    // This regular expression matches strings like (ù{\codeincomments{12345("Product")}}ù).
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Not only do the backslashes obscure the meaning to human readers, a
mechanical translation is often needed{\cprotect\footnote{Such as when
you want to copy the contents of the string literal into an online
  regular-expression validation tool.}} when transforming between source
and data, introducing significant opportunities for human error. Using a
raw string literal solves these problems:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
const char* productIdRegex = R"([0-9]{5}\(".*"\))";
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Another format that benefits from raw string literals is JSON, due to
its frequent use of double quotes:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
const char* testProductResponse = R"(
{
    "productId": "58215(\"Camera\")",
    "availableUnits": 5,
    "relatedProducts": ["59214(\"CameraBag\")", "42931(\"SdStorageCard\")"]
})";
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent With a conventional string literal, the JSON string above would require
every occurrence of \texttt{"} and \texttt{$\backslash$} to be escaped
and every new line to be represented as \texttt{$\backslash$n}, resulting
in visual noise, less interoperability with other tools accepting or
producing JSON, and heightened risk during manual maintenance.

Finally, raw string literals can also be helpful for
whitespace-sensitive languages, such as Python (but see \textit{\titleref{potential-pitfalls-rawstringliteral}: \titleref{encoding-of-newlines-and-whitespace}} on page~\pageref{encoding-of-newlines-and-whitespace}):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
const char* testPythonInterpreterPrint = R"(def test():
    print("test printing from Python")
)";
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection[Potential Pitfalls]{Potential Pitfalls}\label{potential-pitfalls-rawstringliteral}

\subsubsection[Unexpected indentation]{Unexpected indentation}\label{unexpected-indentation}

Consistent indentation and formatting of source code facilitates human
comprehension of program structure. Space and tabulation
(\texttt{$\backslash$t}) characters{\cprotect\footnote{Always
representing indentation as the precise number of spaces (instead of
tab characters) --- especially when committed to source-code control
  systems --- goes a long way to avoiding this issue.}} used for the
purpose of source code formatting are, however, always interpreted as
part of a raw string literal's contents:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
void emitPythonEvaluator(const std::string& expression)
{
    std::cout << R"(
        def evaluate():
            print("Evaluating...")
            return )" << expression;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Despite the intention of the programmer to aid readability by indenting
the above raw string literal consistently with the rest of the code, the
streamed data will contain a large number of spaces (or tabulation
characters), resulting in an invalid Python program:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
        def evaluate():
            print("Evaluating...")
            return someExpression
# ^~~~~~
# Error: excessive indentation
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Correct code would start unindented and then be indented the same number
of spaces (e.g.,~exactly four):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
def evaluate():
    print("Evaluating...")
    return someExpression
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Correct --- albeit visually jarring --- code can be expressed with a
single \emph{raw} string literal, but visualizing the final output requires some effort:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
void emitPythonEvaluator(const char *expression)
{
    std::cout << R"(def evaluate():
    print("Evaluating...")
    return )" << expression;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent When more explicit control is desired, we can use a mixture of
\textbf{raw string literals} and explicit new lines represented as
\textbf{conventional string literals}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
void emitPythonEvaluator2(const char *expression)
{
    std::cout <<
        R"(def evaluate():)"                 "\n"
        R"(    print("Evaluating..."))"      "\n"
        R"(    return )" << expression;
}
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection[Encoding of new lines and whitespace]{Encoding of new lines and whitespace}\label{encoding-of-newlines-and-whitespace}

The intent of the feature is that new lines should map to a single
\texttt{$\backslash$n} character regardless of how new lines are encoded
in the source file. The wording of the C++ Standard, however, is not
entirely clear.\footnote{\textbf{miller13}} While all major compiler
implementations act in accordance with the original intent of the
feature, relying on a specific new line encoding may lead to nonportable
code until clarity is achieved.

In a similar fashion, the type of whitespace characters (e.g., tabs
versus spaces) used as part of a raw string literal can be significant.
As an example, consider a unit test verifying that a string representing
the status of the system is as expected:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
void verifyDefaultOutput()
{
    const std::string output = System::outputStatus();
    const std::string expected = R"(Current status:
    - No violations detected.)";

    EXPECT(output == expected);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent The unit test might pass for years, until, for instance, the
company's indentation style changes from tabulation characters to
spaces, leading to a mismatch and thus test failures.{\cprotect\footnote{A
well-designed unit test will typically be imbued with \emph{expected
values}, rather than values that were produced by the previous run.
The latter is sometimes referred to as a \textbf{benchmark test}, and such tests are often implemented as \emph{diffs} against
a file containing output from a previous run. This file has
presumably been reviewed and is known (believed) to be correct and is sometimes called the \textbf{golden file}. Though ill advised, when trying to get a new version of the software to pass the benchmark test and when the precise format of the output of a system
changes subtly, the \textbf{golden file} may be summarily jettisoned --- and the new
output installed in its stead --- with little if any detailed review.
Hence, well-designed unit tests will often hard code exactly what is
to be expected (nothing more or less) directly in the
  \textbf{test-driver} source code.}}

\begin{wrapfigure}[11]{L}[0pt]{0pt}\includegraphics[trim=0pt 0pt 0pt 13pt]{emcpps-AuthorPhoto-VR}\end{wrapfigure}\noindent \textbf{Vittorio Romeo}  (B.Sc., Computer Science, 2016) is a senior software engineer at Bloomberg in London, working on mission-critical C++ middleware and delivering modern C++ training to hundreds of fellow employees. He began programming at the age of 8 and quickly fell in love with C++. Vittorio has created several open-source C++ libraries and games, has published many video courses and tutorials, and actively participates in the ISO C++ standardization process. He is an active member of the C++ community with an ardent desire to share his knowledge and learn from others: He presented more than 20 times at international C++ conferences (including CppCon, C++Now, ++it, ACCU, C++ On Sea, C++ Russia, and Meeting C++), covering topics from game development to template metaprogramming. Vittorio maintains a website (https://vittorioromeo.info/) with advanced C++ articles and a YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XihgHdkNOQd5IBHnIZWbA) featuring well received modern C++11/14 tutorials. He is active on StackOverflow, taking great care in answering interesting C++ questions (75k+ reputation). When he is not writing code, Vittorio enjoys weightlifting and fitness-related activities as well as computer gaming and sci-fi movies.

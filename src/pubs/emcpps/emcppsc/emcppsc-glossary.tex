  name={Move Semantics},
  description={An operation on two objects, a destination and a source, has \emcppsglossgloss{move semantics}
    if, after it completes, the target object has the same \emcppsglossgloss{value} that the source object had before
    the operation began.  Note that the source object may be modified, and is left in an unspecified state after
    the operation completes.

  Also note that any operation that has \emcppsglossgloss{copy semantics} also has \emcppsglossgloss{move semantics}.}

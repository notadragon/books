Even in the presence of a user-provided
destructor, both the copy constructor and copy-assignment operator
have historically been generated implicitly. Relying on such generated
behavior is not recommended because it is unlikely that a class
requiring a user-provided destructor will function correctly without
corresponding user-provided copy operations. As of C++11, reliance on
  such dubious implicitly generated behavior is deprecated.^^E^^L

Use of a conversion operator to
calculate distance from the origin in this unrealistically simple \texttt{Point}
example is for didactic purposes only. In practice, we would typically
use a named function for this purpose; see {\it\titleref{potential-pitfalls-explicitconv}: \titleref{sometimes-a-named-function-is-better}} on page~\pageref{sometimes-a-named-function-is-better}.^^E^^L

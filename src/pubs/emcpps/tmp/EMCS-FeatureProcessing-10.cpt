Because the
\texttt{[[gnu::warn\_unused\_result]]} attribute does not affect code
generation, it is explicitly \emph{not} ill formed for a client to
make use of an unannotated declaration and yet compile its
corresponding definition in the context of an annotated one (or vice
versa); such is not always the case for other attributes, however, and
  best practice might argue in favor of consistency regardless.^^E^^L

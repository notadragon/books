An
\texttt{std::unordered\_map} is an STL container type that became
available on all conforming platforms along with C++11. The
functionality is similar except that, since it is not required to
support ordered traversal or (worst case) \texttt{O[log(n)]} lookups
and \texttt{O[n*log(n)]} insertions, \texttt{std::unordered\_map} can
be implemented as a hash table instead of a balanced tree, yielding
significantly faster average access times. See

By \emph{semantics} here we typically
mean any observable behavior apart from runtime performance. There
are, however, cases where an attribute is used such that it will not
affect the behavior of a \emph{correct} program, but might affect the
behavior of a well-formed yet incorrect one (see \emph{Use Cases} ,
below).^^E^^L

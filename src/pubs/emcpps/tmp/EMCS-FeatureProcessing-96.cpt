An
exception is made for an object of a type derived from an empty (base)
class in that neither the size nor the alignment of the derived object
is affected by the derivation:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, basicstyle={\ttfamily\footnotesize}]
struct S { int i; }      // size = 4; alignment = 4
struct E { };            // size = 1; alignment = 1
struct D : E { int i };  // size = 4; alignment = 4
\end{lstlisting}

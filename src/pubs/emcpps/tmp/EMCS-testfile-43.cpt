Attempting to
restore a \texttt{union}'s implicitly deleted special member
functions by using the \texttt{=}~\texttt{default} syntax (see
Section~\ref{Defaulted-Special-Member-Functions}, ``\titleref{Defaulted-Special-Member-Functions}") will still result in their being deleted because
the compiler cannot know which member of the union is active without a
  discriminator.^^E^^L

Note that two
consecutive \texttt{!} operators can be used to synthesize a
\textbf{contextual conversion to \texttt{bool}} --- i.e., if \texttt{X} is an
expression that is explicitly convertible to \texttt{bool}, then
\texttt{(!!(X))} will be \texttt{(true)} or \texttt{(false)}
  accordingly.^^E^^L

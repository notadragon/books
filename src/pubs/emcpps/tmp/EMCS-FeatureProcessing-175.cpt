Also note that, since the
deduced \texttt{char} member variable, \texttt{i}, is not materially
used (\textbf{ODR-used}) in the body of the lambda expression assigned
(bound) to \texttt{fC}, some compilers, e.g., Clang, may warn:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, basicstyle={\ttfamily\footnotesize}]
warning: lambda capture 'i' is not required to be captured for this use
\end{lstlisting}

The benchmark
program was compiled using Clang 11.0.0 using \texttt{-Ofast},
\texttt{-march=native}, and \mbox{\texttt{-std=c++11}}. The program was then
executed on a machine running Windows 10 x64, equipped with an Intel
Core i7-9700k CPU (8 cores, 64-byte cache line size). Over the
course of multiple runs, the version of the benchmark without
\texttt{alignas} took 18.5967ms to complete (on average), while the
version with \texttt{alignas} took 2.45333ms to complete (on average).
  See \textbf{{[PRODUCTION: CODE PROVIDED WITH BOOK] alignasbenchmark}} for the source code of the program.^^E^^L

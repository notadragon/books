Note that \texttt{long}~\texttt{long}
and \texttt{unsigned}~\texttt{long}~\texttt{long} are also candidates
for the type of an integer literal having a large enough value. As an
example, the type of the literal \texttt{2147483648} (one more than
the upper bound of a 32-bit integer) is likely to be
  \texttt{long}~\texttt{long} on a 32-bit platform.^^E^^L

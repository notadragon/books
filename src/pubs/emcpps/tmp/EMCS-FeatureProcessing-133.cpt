Another
advantage of an enumerator over an individual constant is that the
enumerator is guaranteed to be a \textbf{compile-time constant} (see
  ``\titleref{constexprvar}" on page~\pageref{constexprvar}) and a \textbf{prvalue} (see
  ``\titleref{Rvalue-References}" on page~\pageref{Rvalue-References}), which never needs static storage
  and cannot have its address taken.^^E^^L

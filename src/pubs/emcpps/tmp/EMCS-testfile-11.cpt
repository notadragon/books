Absolutely no external state changes are
allowed in a function decorated with \texttt{[[gnu::const]]},
including global state changes or mutation via any of the function's
arguments. (The arguments themselves are considered local state and
hence can be modified.) The (more lenient) \texttt{[[gnu::pure]]}
attribute allows changes to the state of the function's arguments but still
forbids any global state mutation. For example, any sort of (even
temporary) global memory allocation would render a function ineligible
  for \texttt{[[gnu::const]]} or \texttt{[[gnu::pure]]}.^^E^^L

Replicating
types that have identical behavior in the name of type safety can run
afoul of interoperability. Distinct types that are otherwise
physically similar are often most appropriate when their respective
behaviors are inherently distinct and unlikely to interact in practice
(e.g., a \mbox{\texttt{CartesianPoint}} and a \mbox{\texttt{RationalNumber}},
each implemented as having two integral data members); see

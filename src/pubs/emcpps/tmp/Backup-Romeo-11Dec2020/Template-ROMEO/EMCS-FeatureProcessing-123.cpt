While
specifying an enumeration's underlying type was impossible before
C++11, the compiler could be forced to choose at least a 32-bit or
64-bit signed integral type by adding an enumerator having a
sufficiently large negative value --- e.g.,
\texttt{-1}~\texttt{<<}~\texttt{31} for a 32-bit and
\texttt{-1}~\texttt{<<}~\texttt{63} for a 64-bit \emph{signed} integer
  (assuming such is available on the target platform).^^E^^L

The compiler-generated version for a
special member function is required to call the corresponding special
member functions on (1) every base class in base-class-declaration
order and then (2) every data member of the encapsulating type in
declaration order (regardless of any access specifiers). Note that the
destructor calls will be in exactly the opposite order of the
  other special-member-function calls.^^E^^L

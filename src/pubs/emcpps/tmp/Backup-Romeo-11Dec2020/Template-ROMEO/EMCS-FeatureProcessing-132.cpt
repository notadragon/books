In this example, we are using a new cross-cutting
feature of all enumerated types that allows the client defining the
type to specify its underlying type precisely. In this case, we have
chosen an \texttt{unsigned}~\texttt{char} to maximize the number of
flag bits while keeping the overall size to a single byte. Three bits
remain available. Had we needed more flag bits, we could have just as
easily used a larger underlying type, such as
  \texttt{unsigned}~\texttt{short}; see ``\titleref{explicit-enumeration-underlying-type}" on page~\pageref{explicit-enumeration-underlying-type}.^^E^^L

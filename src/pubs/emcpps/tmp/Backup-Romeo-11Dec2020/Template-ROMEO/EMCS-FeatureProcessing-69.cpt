The notion that each component
in a subsystem ideally performs one focused function well is sometimes
referred to as separation of (logical) concerns or
  fine-grained (physical) factoring; see \textbf{{lakos20}},
  sections 0.4, 3.2.7, and 3.5.9, pp.~20--28, 529--530, and 674--676,
  respectively.^^E^^L

The
  relative position of \texttt{decltype(range.sort())} in the signature
  of \texttt{sortRangeImpl} is not significant, as long as it is visible
  to the compiler during template substitution. This particular example
  (shown in the main text) makes use of a function parameter that is
  defaulted to \texttt{nullptr}. Alternatives involving a trailing
  return type or a default template argument are also viable:^^E^^L

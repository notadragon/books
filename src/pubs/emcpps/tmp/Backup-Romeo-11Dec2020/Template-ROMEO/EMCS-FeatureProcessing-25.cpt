The technique of exposing a (possibly unused)
unevaluated expression (e.g., using \texttt{decltype}) in a function's
declaration for the purpose of expression-validity detection prior to
template instantiation is commonly known as \textbf{expression SFINAE}\glossary{expression SFINAE}
and is a restricted form of the more general (classical) SFINAE that acts exclusively on
expressions visible in a function's signature rather than on (obscure)
  template-based type computations.^^E^^L

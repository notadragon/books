By \emph{semantics}, here
we typically mean any observable behavior apart from runtime
performance. Generally, ignoring an attribute is a valid (and safe)
choice for a compiler to make. Sometimes, however, an
attribute will not affect the behavior of a \emph{correct} program but might affect the behavior of a well-formed yet incorrect one (see
  {\it\titleref{attribute-use-cases}:} {\it\titleref{delineating-explicit-assumptions-in-code-to-achieve-better-optimizations}} on page~\pageref{delineating-explicit-assumptions-in-code-to-achieve-better-optimizations}).^^E^^L

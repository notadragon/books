A nondeclared
function is nonexistent, which means that it will \emph{not}
participate in overload resolution at all. In contrast, a
\textbf{deleted function} participates in overload resolution and, if
selected, results in a compilation failure; see Section~\ref{deleted-functions}, ``\titleref{deleted-functions}."^^E^^L

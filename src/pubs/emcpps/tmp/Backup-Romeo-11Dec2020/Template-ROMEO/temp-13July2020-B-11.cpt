Absolutely
no external state changes are allowed in a function decorated with
\texttt{[[gnu::const]]}, including global state changes or mutation
via any of the function's arguments (the arguments themselves are
considered local state, and hence can be modified). The (more lenient)
\texttt{[[gnu::pure]]} allows changes to the state of the function's
arguments, but still forbids any global state mutation. For example,
any sort of (even temporary) global memory allocation would be
emphatically disallowed.^^E^^L

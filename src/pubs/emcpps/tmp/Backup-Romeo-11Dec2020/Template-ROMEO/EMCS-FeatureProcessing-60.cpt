Sizes
and alignment shown here are typical but not specifically required by
the standard. On some platforms, one can request that all
types be \textbf{byte aligned}. While such a representation is more
compact, entities that span memory boundaries can require multiple
fetch operations leading to run times that are typically
significantly (sometimes as much as an order of magnitude) slower when
  run in this ``packed'' mode.^^E^^L

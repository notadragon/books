Underspecifying alignment is not reported at
all by GCC 10.1, using the
\texttt{-std=c++11} \texttt{-Wall} \texttt{-Wextra} \mbox{\texttt{-Wpedantic}}
flags. With the same set of options, Clang 10.0 produces a compilation
failure. MSVC v19.24 will produce a warning and ignore any alignment
  less than the minimum one.^^E^^L

Due to the unfathomable amount of software
that would stop working if an \texttt{int} were ever anything but
exactly \emph{four} bytes, we --- along with the late Richard Stevens
  of Unix fame (see \textbf{{stevens93}}, section~2.5.1., pp.~31--32, specifically row~6, column~4, Figure~2.2, p.~32) --- are prepared
  to \emph{guarantee} that it will never become as large as a
  \texttt{long}~\texttt{long} for any general-purpose computer.^^E^^L

The \texttt{[[deprecated]]} attribute can be
used portably to decorate other entities: \texttt{class},
\texttt{struct}, \texttt{union}, type alias, variable, data member,
function, enumeration, template specialization. Applying
\texttt{[[deprecated]]} to a specific enumerator or namespace,
however, is guaranteed to be supported only since C++17; see
  \textbf{smith15a} for more information.^^E^^L

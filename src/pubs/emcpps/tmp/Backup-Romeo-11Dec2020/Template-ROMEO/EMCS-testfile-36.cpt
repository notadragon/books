A \texttt{SmallObjectBuffer} is
  similar to C++17's \texttt{std::any} (\textbf{{cppref\_stdany}}) in
  that it can store any object of any type. Instead of performing
  dynamic allocation to support arbitrarily sized objects, however,
  \texttt{SmallObjectBuffer} uses an internal fixed-size buffer, which
  can lead to better performance and cache locality provided (the
  maximum size of) all of the types involved is known.^^E^^L

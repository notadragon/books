The minimum alignment of an entity is the least restrictive memory-address boundary at which the entity can be placed and have the program continue to work properly. This value is platform dependent and often subject to compiler controls but, by default, is often well approximated by \textbf{natural alignment}; see \textit{\titleref{alignas-appendix}: \titleref{natural-alignment}} on page \pageref{natural-alignment}.^^E^^L

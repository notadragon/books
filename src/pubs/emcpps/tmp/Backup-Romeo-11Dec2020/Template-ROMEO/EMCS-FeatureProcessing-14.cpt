\texttt{gsl::span} is a lightweight reference
type that observes a contiguous sequence (or subsequence) of objects
of homogeneous type. \texttt{gsl::span} can be used in interfaces as
an alternative to both pointer/size or iterator-pair arguments and in
implementations as an alternative to (raw) pointer arithmetic. Since
  C++20, the standard \texttt{std::span} template can be used instead.^^E^^L

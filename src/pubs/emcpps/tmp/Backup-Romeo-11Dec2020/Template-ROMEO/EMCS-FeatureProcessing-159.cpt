All joking aside, \textbf{continuous refactoring} is
an essential responsibility of a development organization, and
deciding when to go back and fix what's suboptimal instead of writing
new code that will please users and contribute more immediately to the
bottom line will forever be a source of tension. Allowing disparate
development teams to address such improvements in their own respective
time frames (perhaps subject to some reasonable overall deadline
date) is a proven real-world practical way of ameliorating this
  tension.^^E^^L

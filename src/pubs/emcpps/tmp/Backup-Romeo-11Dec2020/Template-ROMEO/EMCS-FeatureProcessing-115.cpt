Alisdair Meredith, one of the authors of the
Standards paper that proposed this feature (\textbf{meredith08}) suggests that
placing the \texttt{using} declaration for \textbf{inheriting
constructors} as the very first member declaration and preceding any
\textbf{access specifiers} might be the least confusing location. Programmers might still be confused by
the disparate default access levels of \texttt{class} versus
  \texttt{struct}.^^E^^L

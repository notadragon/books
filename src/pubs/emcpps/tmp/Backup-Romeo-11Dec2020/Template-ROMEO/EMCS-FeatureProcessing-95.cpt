According to the C++11 Standard, ``An object of \textbf{array type} contains a contiguously allocated
  non-empty set of \texttt{N} subobjects of type \texttt{T}''  (\textbf{cpp11}, section 8.3.4, ``Arrays," paragraph 1, p. 188). Note
  that, for every type \texttt{T}, \texttt{sizeof(T)} is always a
  multiple of \texttt{alignof(T)}; otherwise storing multiple \texttt{T} instances in an array would be impossible without padding,
  and the Standard explicitly prohibits padding between array elements.^^E^^L

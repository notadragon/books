C++17
introduces an alternate interface to supply memory allocators via an
abstract base class. The C++17 Standard Library provides a complete
version of standard containers using this more interoperable design in
a sub-namespace, \texttt{std::pmr}, where \texttt{pmr} stands for
\textbf{polymorphic memory resource}. Also adopted as part of C++17
are two concrete memory resources,
\texttt{std::pmr::monotonic\_buffer\_resource} and
  \texttt{std::pmr::unsynchronized\_pool\_resource}.^^E^^L

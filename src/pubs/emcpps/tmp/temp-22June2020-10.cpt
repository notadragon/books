Because the
  \texttt{gnu::warn\_unused\_result} attribute can in no way affect code
  generation, it is explicitly {not} ill-formed for a client to make use
  of an unannotated declaration and yet compile its corresponding
  definition in the context of an annotated one (or vice versa); such is
  not always the case, however, and best practice might argue in favor
  of consistency regardless.^^E^^L

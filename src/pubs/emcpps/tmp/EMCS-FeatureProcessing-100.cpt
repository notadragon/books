We could, in
  addition, use the {\tt alignas} attribute to ensure that
  the minimal alignment of \texttt{d\_buffer} was at least 8 (or even
  16):

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, basicstyle={\ttfamily\footnotesize}]
  // ...
  alignas(8) char d_buffer[39];  // small buffer aligned to (at least) 8
  // ...
  \end{lstlisting}

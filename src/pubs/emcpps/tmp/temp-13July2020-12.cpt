The briefly
adopted --- and then \emph{unadopted} --- contract-checking facility
proposed for C++20 contemplated incorporating a feature similar in
spirit to \texttt{[[gnu::const]]} in which pre-conditions (in addition
to being runtime checked or ignored) could be \emph{assumed}; this
unique use of attribute-like syntax also required that a conforming
implementation could not unilaterally ignore these
precondition-checking attributes as that would make attempting to test
them result in hard (\emph{language}) \emph{undefined behavior}.^^E^^L

The C++
Standard characterizes what constitutes a well-formed program, but
compiler vendors require a great deal of leeway to facilitate the
needs of their users. In case any feature induces warnings,
command line options are typically available to disable those warnings
(\texttt{-Wno-deprecated} in GCC) or methods are in place to suppress those warnings
locally (e.g.,
  \texttt{\#pragma}~\texttt{GCC}~\texttt{diagnostic}~\texttt{ignored}~\texttt{"-Wdeprecated"}).^^E^^L

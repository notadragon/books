\emph{NOTE: This white paper is intended to motivate continued investment in
developing and maturing better memory allocators in the C++ Standard. Although
its instructional content is targeted at Bloomberg engineers, the wider C++
community can benefit from this illustration of the use of memory allocators
in a large industrial codebase, including the related challenges that the
authors are working to alleviate both at Bloomberg and in the C++ Standard.}

Allocator-aware (AA) software — software that allows a client to supply an
allocator at object construction — provides the application developer with an
effective, lower-cost alternative to writing bespoke types having individually
customized memory management.\footnote{Motivational background can be found in
\cite{halpern20a}. Information on using AASI can be found in
\cite{halpern20b}.}  Creating AA software, however, can be
considerably more complex than using existing AA software. After introducing
the requirements for an AA type compatible with the BDE\footnote{BDE is an
initialism that began as Bloomberg Development Environment and is now
understood to simply describe a group within Bloomberg.}  Development
Environment, this paper walks the reader through the steps of transforming
a simple struct into an AA class and then explains how to accomplish this
task for increasingly complex categories of types, culminating with container
class templates.

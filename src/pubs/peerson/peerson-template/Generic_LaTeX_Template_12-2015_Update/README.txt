Before you begin working with the template, please note the following, which will make producing your book easier. After reading these items, proceed to the template, samplebook.tex, in the Template folder.  The sample files are well-commented so you can easily learn how to use them. 

Both the publisher and the template creator assume that you are familiar with LaTeX and know how to create documents using LaTeX.  The expectation is that you have created at least some journal papers or reports using LaTeX.  If this is your first experience with LaTeX, then either you may want to reconsider using LaTeX to create your book or you have ample patience, time, and willingness to learn even while undertaking a book project. If you are indeed just learning LaTeX, a good place to start is Guide to LaTeX by Helmut Kopka and Patrick Daly [Addison-Wesley, 2004]. 

Before you get started, make sure your compiler's installation is up-to-date. 

One of the best features of LaTeX is its platform-independence.  However, storing files in multiple folders undermines that platform-independence since different systems use different file path delimiters; UNIX systems and PCs use / but Macs use :  Some authors try to circumvent this by using a command that alters the / to a : (or vice versa) with one line, but that command consumes pool_size memory that is better used to process the book. Keeping all your files in one folder is a good practice. Doing so may seem less "tidy" but uses memory most efficiently and maintains true platform-independence.  

In most cases, a professional compositor will handle the final layout of your book. If that is the case, please refrain from adding any formatting commands (beyond those supplied in the template) to your files. Often, authors spend time formatting their material, but the publisher's preference for linebreaking, pagebreaking, figure and table placement, and so on differ from the author's, and the compositor ends up deleting the author's formatting commands, which isn't an efficient use of anyone's time. If you are indeed producing the final PDF that will go to the printer, you are encouraged to refrain from doing any formatting work with linebreaks, pagebreaks, figure and table placement, and so on until all the edits and changes to the book have been made. Making a change on one page of a chapter usually changes the text flow for several pages, and re-doing work you have already done is not really fulfilling. 

If you have feedback regarding the template, please share that with your production team or your editor. The goal is to make it easy for authors to use LaTeX to produce their books.  Your feedback helps us do that. 

Happy TeXing!

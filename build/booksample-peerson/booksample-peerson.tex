%%%%%%%%%% First, determine and select the trim size of the book
%
% Pearson uses three basic trim sizes.  Ask your Production Editor which one will be used for your book.
% If your book will be 7 inches wide, use that documentclass statement and comment out the other one.
% If your book will be 7 and 3/8 inches wide, use that documentclass statement and
%            comment out the other one.

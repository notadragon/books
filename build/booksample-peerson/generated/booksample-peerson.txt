        About the Authors
        Joshua Berne serves at Bloomberg LP as a senior software engineer on Bloomberg’s core
        library team. After the difficult choice to pursue a career in software engineering over
        research mathematics, he has been an active programmer in the financial industry, writing
        day trading applications in C++ for E*TRADE Capital Markets and, after that, architecting
        large distributed trading systems in Java for Instinet and IDC. Since joining Bloomberg in
        2017, he has been an active participant in the C++ Standards Committee, seeking to bring
        the advancements made within Bloomberg to the C++ Standard and thus to the rest of the
        world.
